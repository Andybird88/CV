## About Me

I'm a logical, driven problem-solver who has a background in accounting, tiling and fictional writing. I first encountered coding whilst working as an accountant via a popular spreadhseet app. It was here that I started making mini programs for the team to help manage workflow. I also automated some tasks that were being done manually often working into the evening, driven by the impact I was making. 
I left accounting to try something completely different and trained as a tiler. The small but efficient business relied on technology and systems and employed an in-house programmer. In chatting with him I realised that what I had done in the spreadsheet app wasn't actually that far from what he was doing on a daily basis.
I am keen to work in a team that has a positive, supportive culture that values testing and growth mindset.

## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** (18/10/21 - 21/01/22)
_Student_

- Some of the important skills I learned at makers include:
- Communication - Makers has daily pair programming through out the course and this helped me develop my communication even further. It was hard at first as Im used to learning on my own however I was surprised at how quickly I got used to it and found myself excited to see who I was going to work with next. 
- Mentoring - I decided to take on 3 mentee's whilst at makers as I thought I'd throw myself into something out of my comfort zone. I assumed it would be one way but as our relationships developed we ended up learning from each other and had some great chats.

**Pro Tiler Group** (16/10/18 - 19/04/21) 
_Warehouse Operative_

- Small company growing quickly - worked a lot with the in house programmer to help build a warehouse picking system.
- Learned a lot about being on the other side of the team and how important it is to communicate on a project.

**NAB Tiling Services** (24/10/17 - 16/10/18) 
_Apprentice Tiler_

- Learned how to work on my own steam and the rewards of hard physical work.

- Time management skills and working to the exact specification of the customer.

**Travis Perkins PLC** (16/10/12 - 19/04/17)

_Purchase Ledger Finance Team_ (16/10/12 - 18/04/14)
- First encountered VBA and started working with excel to design macros to save myself and others time.
- Promoted to a newly created team to business partner the head office functions. This was based off an excel app I built to help manage the teams workflow. This was used by all teams in the department. I received feedback from multiple sources that it saved hours of time and people thought it was a revelation. After I was promoted I handed over the maintenance to another who commented how simple it was to maintain because of the logical way it had been built.

#### University of Gloucestershire (01/09/06 to 30/06/10)

- Accounting and Finance
- 2:1
- Included a years work experience which I did as a finance assistant with Endsleigh insurance.


#### Skills - Accuracy and Eye for Detail
- Compiling accurate accounting data and business information for managers and directors.
- High levels of attention to detail requiered so that all stakeholders have confidence in the data to make decesions.
- I would often set up 'test' formulae's in spreadsheets to check back to the original data
- Highly effective information that could be produced quickly and accuartly.
- Warehouse work was accuracy focused and was monitored. I had the least errors with the highest picking rate and prided myself on this skill.
#### Skills - Team Working
- Completed the 3 peaks challenge in under 24 hours
- Learned key skills such as the rewards for perseverance and the satisfaction that can be gained from achieving something that takes a lot of work.
- Worked as a team to get everyone through the challenge which included people of all age groups and fitness levels.
- 
#### Skills - Mentoring/pairing
- Became a mentor whilst at makers and paired with people daily.
- Love the mentor/mentee dynamic and appreciate how much value there is for both sides.
- Coached 3 mentee's whilst at makers and built some great relationships/friendships.
- Get great satisfaction out of both teaching and learning.
#### Skills - Empathy and understanding 
- I've been told I have high levels of empathy and feel like this helps me understand and get on with all different types of people.
- I find it really interesting to hear about peoples different backgrounds and cultures. I love finding out more about people and enlightening myself.
- This skill also helps me to look at problems from different angles and consider a more well rounded approach.
- For example whilst at Pro Tiler I would get given the important orders to send out as I would always make sure they were packed with care. Due to the tight schedules of the building industry I understood the importance of getting the materials to the customers on time and un-damaged. This lead to some great relationships with customers and this shows my ability to empathise with the end user.
#### Skills - Problem Solving
- Whilst at Travis Perkins I was often asked to produce data sets to assist with management decesions. These would often be with little explanation and I had to use my own initiative to work out the best way of doing it.
- Due to my success I was asked to help the commercial team out in China. The project was to track the benefit of sourcing products from China and the savings/profit that they generated. This involved speaking to a range of departments both uk and abroad. Often the data was incomplete or not uploaded in time. I took charge and became the go to person for tracking the financials.
