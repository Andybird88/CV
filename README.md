## About Me

I'm a logical, driven problem solver who has a background in accounting, tiling and fictional writing. I am keen to work in a team that has a positive supportive culture where TDD principles are followed and the growth mind set is held in high regard.

I first encountered coding whilst working as an accountant via a popular spreadhseet app. It was here that I started making mini programs for the team to help manage workflow. I also automated some tasks that were being done manually. I enjoyed doing this so much that I would spend time in the evenings outside of normal working hours developing as I was driven by the fact I was making a real impact and improving peoples lives at work.

It was difficult for me to leave my stable career as an accountatnt that I had worked so hard for. I am proud of myself for having the courage to admit I didn't enjoy what I did and also the courage to find what I did enjoy and go after it.

I decided to try something completley different and went into tiling and through that ended up getting a job at a small but fastly growing online tiling supplies business. I admired the way they worked and the drive to become the most efficent small business relying less on large numbers of staff but more on technology and systems. This is where I was able to get further insight into programing and after chatting with the in-house programmer he was able to show me that what I had done in the spreadsheet app wasn't actually that far from what he was doing on a day to day basis.

It was this revelation that set the spark for my prgramming career and opening up a whole new world of possibilites. I started doing online courses and that lead me to consider doing a bootcamp. After doing some research I had my heart set on doing makers. I was so excited when I got accpeted onto the course and this was the first step for me in realising anything is possible if you put your mind to it.

## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** (18/10/21 - 21/01/22)
_Student_

- Some of the important skills I learned at makers include:
- Communication - Makers has daily pair programming through out the course and this helped me develop my communication even further. It was hard at first as Im used to learning on my own however I was surprised at how quickly I got used to it and found myself excited to see who I was going to work with next. 
- Mentoring - I decided to take on 3 mentee's whilst at makers as I thought I'd throw myself into something out of my comfort zone. I assumed it would be one way but as our relationships developed we ended up learning from each other and had some great chats.

**Pro Tiler Group** (16/10/18 - 19/04/21) 
_Warehouse Operative_

- Small company growing quickly - worked a lot with the in house programmer to help build a warehouse picking system.
- Learned a lot about being on the other side of the team and how important it is to communicate on a project.

_Apprentice Tiler_

- Promoted to a newly created team to business partner the head office functions. This was based off an excel app I built to help manage the teams workflow. This was used by all teams in the department. I received feedback from multiple sources that it saved hours of time and people thought it was a revelation. After I was promoted I handed over the maintenance to another who commented how simple it was to maintain because of the logical way it had been built.

#### University of Gloucestershire (01/09/06 to 30/06/10)

- Accounting and Finance

- Included a years work experience which I did as a finance assistant with Endsleigh insurance.


#### Skills - Accuracy and Eye for Detail
- Compiling accurate accounting data and business information for managers and directors.
- High levels of attention to detail requiered so that all stakeholders have confidence in the data to make decesions.
- I would often set up 'test' formulae's in spreadsheets to check back to the original data
- Highly effective information that could be produced quickly and accuartly.
- Warehouse work was accuracy focused and was monitored. I had the least errors with the highest picking rate and prided myself on this skill.

#### Skills - Mentoring/pairing
- Became a mentor whilst at makers and paired with people daily.
- Love the mentor/mentee dynamic and appreciate how much value there is for both sides.
- Coached 3 mentee's whilst at makers and built some great relationships/friendships.
- Get great satisfaction out of both teaching and learning.
#### Skills - Empathy and understanding 
- I've been told I have high levels of empathy and feel like this helps me understand and get on with all different types of people.
- I find it really interesting to hear about peoples different backgrounds and cultures. I love finding out more about people and enlightening myself.
- This skill also helps me to look at problems from different angles and consider a more well rounded approach.
- For example whilst at Pro Tiler I would get given the important orders to send out as I would always make sure they were packed with care. Due to the tight schedules of the building industry I understood the importance of getting the materials to the customers on time and un-damaged. This lead to some great relationships with customers and this shows my ability to empathise with the end user.
#### Skills - Problem Solving
- Whilst at Travis Perkins I was often asked to produce data sets to assist with management decesions. These would often be with little explanation and I had to use my own initiative to work out the best way of doing it.
- Due to my success I was asked to help the commercial team out in China. The project was to track the benefit of sourcing products from China and the savings/profit that they generated. This involved speaking to a range of departments both uk and abroad. Often the data was incomplete or not uploaded in time. I took charge and became the go to person for tracking the financials.
